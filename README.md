# Stack Orchestrator

Stack Orchestrator allows building and deployment of a Laconic Stack on a single machine with minimial prerequisites. It is a Python3 CLI tool that runs on any OS with Python3 and Docker. The following diagram summarizes the relevant repositories in the Laconic Stack - and the relationship to Stack Orchestrator.

## Install

**To get started quickly** on a fresh Ubuntu instance (e.g, Digital Ocean); [try this script](./scripts/quick-install-ubuntu.sh). **WARNING:** always review scripts prior to running them so that you know what is happening on your machine.

For any other installation, follow along below and **adapt these instructions based on the specifics of your system.**

Ensure that the following are already installed:

- [Python3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download): `python3 --version` >= `3.8.10` (the Python3 shipped in Ubuntu 20+ is good to go)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): `docker --version` >= `20.10.21`
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/): `jq --version` >= `1.5`

Note: if installing docker via package manager on Linux (as opposed to Docker Desktop), you must [install the compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually), e.g. :

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.11.2/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Next decide on a directory where you would like to put the stack-orchestrator program. Typically this would be 
a "user" binary directory such as `~/bin` or perhaps `/usr/local/laconic` or possibly just the current working directory.

Now, having selected that directory, download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/cerc-io/stack-orchestrator/tags) into it (we're using `~/bin` below for concreteness but edit to suit if you selected a different directory). Also be sure that the destination directory exists and is writable:

```bash
curl -L -o ~/bin/laconic-so https://github.com/cerc-io/stack-orchestrator/releases/latest/download/laconic-so
```

Give it execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x ~/bin/laconic-so
```

Ensure `laconic-so` is on the [`PATH`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059)

Verify operation (your version will probably be different, just check here that you see some version outut and not an error):

```
laconic-so version
Version: v1.0.27-7831078
```

## Usage

Three sub-commands: `setup-repositories`, `build-containers` and `deploy-system` are generally run in order. The following is a slim example for standing up the `erc20-watcher`. Go further with the [erc20 watcher demo](/app/data/stacks/erc20) and other pieces of the stack, within the [`stacks` directory](/app/data/stacks).

### Setup Repositories

Clone the set of git repositories necessary to build a system:

```bash
laconic-so --stack erc20 setup-repositories
```

This will default to cloning git reposiories into: `~/cerc` or - if set - the environment variable `CERC_REPO_BASE_DIR`

### Build Containers

Build the set of docker container images required to run a system. It takes around 10 minutes to build all the containers from scratch.

```bash
laconic-so --stack erc20 build-containers
```

### Deploy System

Uses `docker compose` to deploy a system (with most recently built container images).

```bash
laconic-so --stack erc20 deploy-system up
```

### Cleanup

```bash
laconic-so --stack erc20 deploy-system down
```

## Platform Support

Native aarm64 is _not_ currently supported. x64 emulation on ARM64 macos should work (not yet tested).

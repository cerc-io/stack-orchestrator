# Azimuth Watcher

Instructions to setup and deploy Azimuth Watcher stack

## Setup

Prerequisite: `ipld-eth-server` RPC and GQL endpoints

Clone required repositories:

```bash
laconic-so --stack azimuth setup-repositories --pull
```

NOTE: If the repository already exists and checked out to a different version, `setup-repositories` command will throw an error.
For getting around this, the `azimuth-watcher-ts` repository can be removed and then run the command again.

Build the container images:

```bash
laconic-so --stack azimuth build-containers
```

This should create the required docker images in the local image registry.

## Create a deployment

First, create a spec file for the deployment, which will map the stack's ports and volumes to the host:
```bash
laconic-so --stack azimuth deploy init --output azimuth-spec.yml
```

### Ports

Edit `network` in spec file to map container ports to same ports in host

```yaml
...
network:
  ports:
    watcher-db:
     - 0.0.0.0:15432:5432
    azimuth-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3001:3001
    censures-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3002:3002
    claims-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3003:3003
    conditional-star-release-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3004:3004
    delegated-sending-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3005:3005
    ecliptic-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3006:3006
    linear-star-release-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3007:3007
    polls-watcher-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:3008:3008
    gateway-server:
     - 0.0.0.0:4000:4000
...
```

### Data volumes
Container data volumes are bind-mounted to specified paths in the host filesystem.
The default setup (generated by `laconic-so deploy init`) places the volumes in the `./data` subdirectory of the deployment directory. The default mappings can be customized by editing the "spec" file generated by `laconic-so deploy init`.

---

Once you've made any needed changes to the spec file, create a deployment from it:
```bash
laconic-so --stack azimuth deploy create --spec-file azimuth-spec.yml --deployment-dir azimuth-deployment
```

## Set env variables

Inside the deployment directory, open the file `config.env` and add variable to update RPC endpoint :

  ```bash
  # External RPC endpoints
  CERC_IPLD_ETH_RPC=
  ```

* NOTE: If RPC endpoint is on the host machine, use `host.docker.internal` as the hostname to access the host port, or use the `ip a` command to find the IP address of the `docker0` interface (this will usually be something like `172.17.0.1` or `172.18.0.1`)

## Start the stack

Start the deployment:
```bash
laconic-so deployment --dir azimuth-deployment start
```

* List and check the health status of all the containers using `docker ps` and wait for them to be `healthy`

## Clean up

To stop all azimuth services running in the background, while preserving chain data:

```bash
laconic-so deployment --dir azimuth-deployment stop
```

To stop all azimuth services and also delete data:

```bash
laconic-so deployment --dir azimuth-deployment stop --delete-volumes
```

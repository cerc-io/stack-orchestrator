# self-hosted uniswap frontend

Instructions to setup and deploy uniswap app on urbit

Build and deploy:

- Urbit
- Uniswap app

## Setup

Clone required repositories:

```bash
laconic-so --stack uniswap-frontend setup-repositories

# If this throws an error as a result of being already checked out to a branch/tag in a repo, remove the repositories mentioned below and re-run the command
```

Build the container images:

```bash
laconic-so --stack uniswap-frontend build-containers
```

## Create a deployment

First, create a spec file for the deployment, which will map the stack's ports and volumes to the host:

```bash
laconic-so --stack uniswap-frontend deploy init --output uniswap-frontend-spec.yml
```

### Ports

Edit `network` in spec file to map container ports to same ports in host

<!-- TODO: Provide example -->

### Data volumes
Container data volumes are bind-mounted to specified paths in the host filesystem.
The default setup (generated by `laconic-so deploy init`) places the volumes in the `./data` subdirectory of the deployment directory. The default mappings can be customized by editing the "spec" file generated by `laconic-so deploy init`.

---

Once you've made any needed changes to the spec file, create a deployment from it:
```bash
laconic-so --stack uniswap-frontend deploy create --spec-file uniswap-frontend-spec.yml --deployment-dir uniswap-frontend-deployment
```

## Set env variables

Inside the deployment directory, open the file `config.env` and add variable for infura key :

  ```bash
  # External RPC endpoints
  # https://docs.infura.io/getting-started#2-create-an-api-key
  CERC_INFURA_KEY=
  ```

## Start the stack

Start the deployment:
```bash
laconic-so deployment --dir uniswap-frontend-deployment start
```

* List and check the health status of all the containers using `docker ps` and wait for them to be `healthy`

## Clean up

To stop all azimuth services running in the background, while preserving chain data:

```bash
laconic-so deployment --dir uniswap-frontend-deployment stop
```

To stop all azimuth services and also delete data:

```bash
laconic-so deployment --dir uniswap-frontend-deployment stop --delete-volumes
```
